I started learning web dev a month after graduation. I chose Java, thinking it would open up more job opportunities on the corporate side (Given the job market is tough everywhere). However, a month later, a friend of mine convinced me that web development could offer even more opportunities.

</br>

I had nothing to lose, so I began learning another language againâ€”this time it was easier, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez" class="font-semibold" target="_blank">Bro Code</a> where I had previously learned Java from his courses.

</br>

As I started working on projects, my learning pace accelerated. One of my early projects involved creating a library using the Google Books API to search for books and the Anna Archives to retrieve e-books to read from. I had difficulties making them work together, especially since I didn't have Anna's API or database; I simply was web scraping for books, which is not an ideal practice (Sorry, Anna).

</br>

In mid-November, I decided to create an Upwork account with the hope of securing a freelance job. Unfortunately, there was too much competition, and it was hard to stand out as a new freelancer.

## **Motivation for making this project:**

Browsing Upwork, I noticed alot of jobs asking to turn a figma desing into website, I am obviosly new to web dev so i never worked with figma designs. I thought if i made a project using a figma desing i would have more job oppurtinties. So i chose a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1113372221049615805" class="font-semibold" target="_blank">design</a> i liked and started working from it.
